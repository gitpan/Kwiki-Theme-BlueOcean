Kwiki-Theme-BlueOcean

Provides a blue looking them for Kwiki. It is based on the GreenHouse theme
with a focus on making it easier to read. Simply remove the existing theme
and add this theme to your Kwiki installation.

This theme is special in the fact that it is built to work with
Kwiki::TableOfContents. It would be nice to get this theme to work without
this module also but I don't have time for that right now. So if you use this
theme you must install Kwiki::TableOfContents

It also depends on some other Kwiki modules. Again it would be nice to remove
these dependencies and make those modules optional.

INSTALLATION

To install this module and add it to your kwiki,
run the following commands as root:

%> kwiki -install Kwiki::Theme::BlueOcean

You many already have a theme installed. If that is the case simply remove the
existing theme. Below is an example:

%> kwiki -remove Kwiki::Theme::Basic
